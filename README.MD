## ‚ú® Current Nodes

### 1) Multipurpose Configuration
A minimal utility node that exposes two *in-node* controls and emits their values as sockets:

- **Megapixels (FLOAT)** ‚Äî set a target megapixel resolution value directly in the node (no external input required). Ideal for driving resizers that accept a `FLOAT` input.  
- **Mask Prompt (STRING)** ‚Äî a multiline text field where you can type prompt text for masking/selection nodes that accept a `STRING`.
